Lyrics:-
(Manto) Sawal Yeh Hai Ki Jo Chiz Jaisi Hai Usse Waisi Hi Pesh Kyu Na Kiya Jaaye 
(Manto) Main Toh Bus Aapni Kahaaniyon Ko Ek Aaina Samjata Hoon Jisme Samaaj Aapne Aapko Dekh Sake 
Aaina Na Dekhna Chahe Samaaj Mera 
Puche Mera Kal Na Dekhte Yeh Aaj Mera 
Khodate Kharodate Yeh Meri Galatiyan 
Main Bhi Chal Diya 
Meri Soch Pe Hai Raj Mera 
Kaan Band Aankhe Band Inke Muh Pe Taale 
Inpe Jor Na Ki Satya Pe Prakash Daale 
Bole Sach Jo Uske Cheere Pe Tezaab Daale. 
Ghume Fir Khule Me, Aur Jaale Jo Wo Nakaab Daale. 
Off Off Off Hai. Dimag Sabka Off Hai. 
Zamaana Kya Kahega Iska Hi Toh Sabko Khauff Hai 
Daabke Jeete Hai. Daabane Ke Yeh Aadhi Hai. 
S**.. Nishedh Hai Toh Itni Kyu Aabaadi Hai. 
Log Yeh Hai Aatma Se Khokale. Khud Kare Toh Thik Baaki Kare‚Ä¶ Doogale. 

Gaali De Doon Hindi Me Toh Bole Aisa Kyu Kiya. 
F*** Kyu Hai Cool Jaane Galat Kyu Hai C******. 
(Manto) Kya Iss Tarah Ke Alfaz Hame Sadako Pe Sunayi Nahi Padte. 
(Manto) Manto Ek Insaan Hai X4 
(Manto) Mujh Par Ilzam Hai X3 
(Manto) Manto Ek Insaan Hai 
Jaat Mein Yeh Baatate Hai. Baat Ke Yeh Kaatate Hai. 
Kaatne Waale Khat Pe Hai. Inki Mauj Raat Me Hai. 
Laal Batti Wali Gaddi, Glass Inke Hath Me Hai. 
Rajneeti Me Hai Chor, Police Inke Sath Me Hai. 
Meri Baate Tumhe Sach Nahi Lagti. Sachi Baate Tumko Yaara Pacch Nahi Sakti. 
Mujhse Naa Samaj Hai Dugane Meri Age Ke. Ek Pair Kabar Me Yeh Bhuke Hai Dahej Ke. 
Betiyon Ko Maarte. Betiya Na Paalte. Betiyon Pe Dusro Ki Yeh Nazare Gaandi Daalte. 
Ladkiya Patake Unko Bandi Bolte Hai. Aur Jo Raazi Na Hoon Unko S**** R***** Bolte Hai. 
Baa Par Roz Maa Pe Tos, Hath Jo Uthayega. 
Bezuban Bolne Se Phele Shikh Jaayega Ki Mard Tab Banega Jab Tu Aurate Daabayega. 
Soch Yeh Rahi Toh Jaldi Desh Doob Jaayega. 
(Manto) Main Society Ki Choli Kya Utaarunga. Joh Phele Se Hi Nangi Hai. Usse Kapde Pehnana Mera Kaam Nahi Hai. 

(Manto) Main Kaali Takti Par Safed Chalk Istamaal Karta Hoon. Taaki Kaali Takti Aur Nimaya Hojaaye. 
(Manto) Manto Ek Insaan Hai. 
Mene Ghanto Padha Hai Tumko Manto. Tumhare Jaisa Baanu Kare Mera Maan Toh. 
Inn Panto Ko Sach Nahi Dikhta. 
Saatar Saal Aazaadi Ke Aisa Charge Bhi Nahi Bikta. 
(Manto) Agar Aap Meri Kahaaniyon Ko Bardasht Nahi Kar Sakti. 
(Manto) Toh Iska Matlab Yeh Hai Ki Zamaana Hi Naqabil E Bardasht Hai.

Teri Nazar Ne Yeh Kya Kar Diya
Mujhse Hi Mujhko Juda Kar Diya
Main Rehta Hoon Tere Paas Kahin
Ab Mujhko Mera Ehsaas Nahin
Dil Kehta Hai Kasam Se

Lyrics:
Ke Thoda Thoda Pyaar Hua Tumse
Ke Thoda Thoda Ikraar Hua Tumse
Ke Zyaada Bhi Hoga Tumhi Se 
Ke Thoda Thoda Pyaar Hua Tumse

Meri Aankhon Ki Dua
Hai Yeh Chehra Tera
Ab Dekhe Bin Tujhe 
Na Guzaara Ho Mera

Mein Saans Bhi Loon Tujhe Chahe Bin
Ab Hoga Na Yeh Humse

Ke Thoda Thoda Pyaar Hua Tumse
Ke Thoda Thoda Ikraar Hua Tumse
Ke Zyaada Bhi Hoga Tumhi Se 
Ke Thoda Thoda Pyaar Hua Tumse

Lyrics: 
Naa Dooja Koi, Naa Dooja Koi Main Toh Teri Deewani Hoyi
Naa Dooja Koi, Naa Dooja Koi Main Toh Teri Deewani Hoyi
Mera Des Hai Na Pardes, Tera Bhes Hi Mera Bhes, 
Tu Hi Gaon Hai Tu Hi Naiya Main Toh Teri Ho Gayiya
Des Hai Na Pardes, Tera Bhes Hi Mera Bes, 
Tu Hi Gaon Hai Tu Hi Naiya Main Toh Teri Ho Gayiya

Main Toh Khoyi, Usi Mein Khoyi, 
Main Toh Khud Se Begaani Hoyi
Main Toh Khoyi, Usi Mein Khoyi, 
Main Uski Kahaani Hoyi
Hai Pagal Mera Yaar, Na Maqsad Hai Na Auzar, 
Seekhe Na Yeh Duniya Daari Phir Bhi Us Pe Dil Haari.
Hai Pagal Mera Yaar, Na Maqsad Hai Na Auzar, 
Seekhe Na Yeh Duniya Daari Phir Bhi Us Pe Dil Haari.

Main Pehle Royi, Haan Pehle Royi, 
Phir Main Bhi Mere Yaar Ke Jaisi Hoyi
Main Pehle Royi, Haan Pehle Royi, 
Phir Main Bhi Mere Yaar Ke Jaisi Hoyi
Hum Jhoome Baadal Paar, Aur Phir Taire Nadi Hazaar. 
Main Leher Banu Woh Dariya Uska Dil Mera Zariya
Hum Jhoome Baadal Paar, Aur Phir Taire Nadi Hazaar. 
Main Leher Banu Woh Dariya Uska Dil Mera Zariya

Naa Dooja Koi, Naa Dooja Koi 
Main Toh Teri Deewani Hoyi
Naa Dooja Koi, Naa Dooja Koi 
Main Toh Teri Deewani Hoyi

Teri main balayein loon
Tujhe main duaayein doon
Tujhko main khushiyon ke saaye doon
Khwabon ko sajaaye tu
Aankhon mein basaaye tu
Tujhko main doon sab jo chaahe tu
Saari raat ye pehra kare
Keh doon chand taaron ko
Chaoro chaoro icha paari chaoro
Chaoro chaoro icha paari chaoro

Jaag jaaye na tu, jaagu raaton main
Jhoole jhoola tu mere haathon mein
Teri chumu aankhein main baith sirhane
Saari raat ye pehra kare
Keh doon chaand taaron ko
Chaoro chaoro icha paari chaoro
Chaoro chaoro icha paari chaoro

Hmm.. hm..

Presenting the first song ‚ÄòDil Hi Toh Hai‚Äô from the upcoming movie ‚ÄòThe Sky Is Pink‚Äô. The song is composed by Pritam and sung by Arijit Singh & Antara Mitra.

The Sky Is Pink is the incredible love story of a couple spanning 25 years, told through the lens of their teenage daughter. She is sassy, sardonic, spunky and also‚Ä¶dead! A fact she nonchalantly mentions at the very outset. ‚ÄúGet over it. It‚Äôs quite cool actually. You‚Äôll see when you get here (which you do know you will right?!)‚Äù Unexpectedly humorous, warm and heart wrenching all at once as the magic of life and beauty of death manifest in one family‚Äôs unusual, courageous journey in this 100% true story.

Lyrics:-
(Manto) Sawal Yeh Hai Ki Jo Chiz Jaisi Hai Usse Waisi Hi Pesh Kyu Na Kiya Jaaye 
(Manto) Main Toh Bus Aapni Kahaaniyon Ko Ek Aaina Samjata Hoon Jisme Samaaj Aapne Aapko Dekh Sake 
Aaina Na Dekhna Chahe Samaaj Mera 
Puche Mera Kal Na Dekhte Yeh Aaj Mera 
Khodate Kharodate Yeh Meri Galatiyan 
Main Bhi Chal Diya 
Meri Soch Pe Hai Raj Mera 
Kaan Band Aankhe Band Inke Muh Pe Taale 
Inpe Jor Na Ki Satya Pe Prakash Daale 
Bole Sach Jo Uske Cheere Pe Tezaab Daale. 
Ghume Fir Khule Me, Aur Jaale Jo Wo Nakaab Daale. 
Off Off Off Hai. Dimag Sabka Off Hai. 
Zamaana Kya Kahega Iska Hi Toh Sabko Khauff Hai 
Daabke Jeete Hai. Daabane Ke Yeh Aadhi Hai. 
S**.. Nishedh Hai Toh Itni Kyu Aabaadi Hai. 
Log Yeh Hai Aatma Se Khokale. Khud Kare Toh Thik Baaki Kare‚Ä¶ Doogale. 

Gaali De Doon Hindi Me Toh Bole Aisa Kyu Kiya. 
F*** Kyu Hai Cool Jaane Galat Kyu Hai C******. 
(Manto) Kya Iss Tarah Ke Alfaz Hame Sadako Pe Sunayi Nahi Padte. 
(Manto) Manto Ek Insaan Hai X4 
(Manto) Mujh Par Ilzam Hai X3 
(Manto) Manto Ek Insaan Hai 
Jaat Mein Yeh Baatate Hai. Baat Ke Yeh Kaatate Hai. 
Kaatne Waale Khat Pe Hai. Inki Mauj Raat Me Hai. 
Laal Batti Wali Gaddi, Glass Inke Hath Me Hai. 
Rajneeti Me Hai Chor, Police Inke Sath Me Hai. 
Meri Baate Tumhe Sach Nahi Lagti. Sachi Baate Tumko Yaara Pacch Nahi Sakti. 
Mujhse Naa Samaj Hai Dugane Meri Age Ke. Ek Pair Kabar Me Yeh Bhuke Hai Dahej Ke. 
Betiyon Ko Maarte. Betiya Na Paalte. Betiyon Pe Dusro Ki Yeh Nazare Gaandi Daalte. 
Ladkiya Patake Unko Bandi Bolte Hai. Aur Jo Raazi Na Hoon Unko S**** R***** Bolte Hai. 
Baa Par Roz Maa Pe Tos, Hath Jo Uthayega. 
Bezuban Bolne Se Phele Shikh Jaayega Ki Mard Tab Banega Jab Tu Aurate Daabayega. 
Soch Yeh Rahi Toh Jaldi Desh Doob Jaayega. 
(Manto) Main Society Ki Choli Kya Utaarunga. Joh Phele Se Hi Nangi Hai. Usse Kapde Pehnana Mera Kaam Nahi Hai. 

(Manto) Main Kaali Takti Par Safed Chalk Istamaal Karta Hoon. Taaki Kaali Takti Aur Nimaya Hojaaye. 
(Manto) Manto Ek Insaan Hai. 
Mene Ghanto Padha Hai Tumko Manto. Tumhare Jaisa Baanu Kare Mera Maan Toh. 
Inn Panto Ko Sach Nahi Dikhta. 
Saatar Saal Aazaadi Ke Aisa Charge Bhi Nahi Bikta. 
(Manto) Agar Aap Meri Kahaaniyon Ko Bardasht Nahi Kar Sakti. 
(Manto) Toh Iska Matlab Yeh Hai Ki Zamaana Hi Naqabil E Bardasht Hai.

Dil Kehta Hai Kasam Se

Lyrics:
Ke Thoda Thoda Pyaar Hua Tumse
Ke Thoda Thoda Ikraar Hua Tumse
Ke Zyaada Bhi Hoga Tumhi Se 
Ke Thoda Thoda Pyaar Hua Tumse

Meri Aankhon Ki Dua
Hai Yeh Chehra Tera
Ab Dekhe Bin Tujhe 
Na Guzaara Ho Mera

Mein Saans Bhi Loon Tujhe Chahe Bin
Ab Hoga Na Yeh Humse

Ke Thoda Thoda Pyaar Hua Tumse
Ke Thoda Thoda Ikraar Hua Tumse
Ke Zyaada Bhi Hoga Tumhi Se 
Ke Thoda Thoda Pyaar Hua Tumse

Hum Jhoome Baadal Paar, Aur Phir Taire Nadi Hazaar. 
Main Leher Banu Woh Dariya Uska Dil Mera Zariya
Hum Jhoome Baadal Paar, Aur Phir Taire Nadi Hazaar. 
Main Leher Banu Woh Dariya Uska Dil Mera Zariya

Naa Dooja Koi, Naa Dooja Koi

Teri main balayein loon

Tujhko main khushiyon ke saaye doon
Khwabon ko sajaaye tu

Tujhko main doon sab jo chaahe tu
Saari raat ye pehra kare
Keh doon chand taaron ko
Chaoro chaoro icha paari chaoro
Chaoro chaoro icha paari chaoro

Jaag jaaye na tu, jaagu raaton main
Jhoole jhoola tu mere haathon mein
Teri chumu aankhein main baith sirhane

Keh doon chaand taaron ko
Chaoro chaoro icha paari chaoro
Chaoro chaoro icha paari chaoro

Presenting the first song ‚ÄòDil Hi Toh Hai‚Äô from the upcoming movie ‚ÄòThe Sky Is Pink‚Äô. The song is composed by Pritam and sung by Arijit Singh & Antara Mitra.

The Sky Is Pink is the incredible love story of a couple spanning 25 years, told through the lens of their teenage daughter. She is sassy, sardonic, spunky and also‚Ä¶dead! A fact she nonchalantly mentions at the very outset. ‚ÄúGet over it. It‚Äôs quite cool actually. You‚Äôll see when you get here (which you do know you will right?!)‚Äù Unexpectedly humorous, warm and heart wrenching all at once as the magic of life and beauty of death manifest in one family‚Äôs unusual, courageous journey in this 100% true story.
